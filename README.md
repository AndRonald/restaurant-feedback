# FEED HOUSE 
Feed house is a project developed by UniFecaf students, with the aim of being a platform where customers can leave feedback about their experiences in restaurants, and restaurants can use this information to improve their services. The platform can include sentiment analysis and feedback trends.
I believe everyone has good memories with some food. Our application aims to demonstrate, through restaurant interactions and promotions, the feelings conveyed when tasting great food and being inspired by this, we decided to create this sharing environment



## Discontinued version
Due to project problems, we decided to proceed with the wix platform, you can access it here: https://tiagocirqueira.wixsite.com/feed-house

# Why Platforms and Methodologies?
The main objective of going deeper into the research is to really understand the project and how to make it relevant to other people, minimizing errors; understanding the workflow; how to avoid bugs and so on.


### INSTALLATION

# to start our website on your machine (LOCAL):

```bash
